**WELCOME TO DROP'ED**

User Guide:
This is very simple as there are only a few things that you have to concern yourself with
If you've installed this version of DROP'ED, that means you're trying to access our codebase!
In which case, good luck my friend! :)

The backend stuff is located inside of /deckathonRegister.js
If you're trying to run just the backend a single time, feel free the script itself as it comes built in with testing features
Before running though, make sure that you have ran "npm install"
If you're trying to test reliability, run /run10.js
It'll run 10 consecutive times and print out the results (success or failure)

The electron app stuff is located inside of /frontend
If you're trying to run the frontend, navigate to the /frontend directory 
Then run "npm install"
And then run "npm run dev"
That'll run the development build

If you're trying to build the .exe file, navigate to the /frontend directory and run "npm run build"

If you pulled from the repository, you should be missing a .env file in the root directory, in which case you'll need to create one
Using the env_example.env as a template, create a .env file and fill in the values
example:
GEMINI_API_KEY=uaishdIAWGBLIGYR#yuta7tdAIUWYG
CHROME_PATH=C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe
(the gemini key was me mashing my forehead into my keyboard)
